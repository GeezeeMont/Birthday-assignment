# Birthday-assignment
Simple website project that wishes a good friend a happy birthday. The site is broke into multiple sections: 
- First section: displays three gifs in a flexbox.
- Second section: displays a looping, autoplaying mp4 file
- Third section: displays a controlplay mp4 file.

There are occasional text boxes that say positive and supportive messages.
